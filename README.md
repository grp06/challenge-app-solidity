# Book Club DAO

### How it works

This is an app to create personal development challenges with your friends/community. The first example of such a challenge will be a book club. Together, with a group of friends, we will read "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari.

To enter the book club challenge, each person will deposit some ETH. The challenge will last 10 weeks and each week there will be a Zoom call to discuss the previous week's reading (just like a traditional book club).

When a member attends a meeting, they will receive 1/10 of their initial deposit back. So, if you read the book, attend all the meetings, you'll get all your ETH back.

BUT, if you don't attend any individual meeting, then 1/10 of your initial deposit gets distributed to everyone else in the book club.

A final spin on it: since everyone deposits their ETH at the beginning of the challenge, the protocol will invest everyone's ETH into AAVE, which will earn yield during the challenge.

Half of that yield will go to the Book Club DAO to grow the protocol and the other half will be distributed to the members, proportional to the number of meetings they attended during the challenge.

The end result is that we're building an ecosystem for social challenges where users will:
* Improve themselves via self development activities.
* Build community together.
* Earn yield on the ETH they deposit to the smart contract.
* Grow the protocol to encourage more self development communities to form.
* Increase adoption of ETH and crypto more broadly.

Beyond book clubs, there is unbounded potential for friend groups and communities to be creative and run all kinds of challenges. The challenges will be fully customizable including:
* Entry fee
* Yield farming strategy and the distribution of earnings
* Length of challenge
* Number of people on the "board" who take attendance app
